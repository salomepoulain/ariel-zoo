GENOTYPE:
multineat.genome graph NN [cppnwin]


MUTATION:
mutation_prob = 0.8
mutation_operator: standard mutation:
    - uses a shit ton of paramters
    - MutateWeightsProb = 0.9
        - MaxWeight = 8.0
        - WeightMutationMaxPower = 0.2
        - WeightReplacementMaxPower = 1


CROSSOVER:
crossover_prob = 0.8
operator: standard crossover
    - Apply NEAT crossover via MateWithConstraints()
        - most similar to uniform crossover
        

PARENT_SELECTION
Tournament Selection (k=UNCLEAR, LIKELY 2) with Unique Pairing (yes Replacement across pairs)

SURVIVAL_SELECTION
Tournament Selection (k=UNCLEAR, LIKELY 2)

NOVLETY:
Mean distance to k-nearest neighbors in morphology space
  - Calculate distance in N-dimensional morphology space
  - Take k nearest neighbors
  - Average their distances

FITNESS:
speed x novelty
speed = sqrt(x² + y²) / 60
    - x, y = final position after 60 seconds
    - sqrt(x² + y²) = Euclidean distance from starting point
    - /60 = convert to speed (cm/s)


EA_PARAMS:
Population size: 500 
Offspring size: 100


CONTROLLER:


  │ population_management          │ steady_state_population_management │ Line 96  │ Survival selection strategy    │
  The tournament size k is NOT explicitly specified in the parent_selection or population_management_selector parameters.




Penalty:
The Penalty: The term is max(0.1,1−E), where E calculates the ratio of "limb-like" modules (modules with 2 connections) to the maximum possible chain length.


Neighbors (k): They used k=1. This means the novelty score is simply the distance to the single most similar robot ever seen.

Comparison Pool: The robot is compared against the current population PLUS a historical Archive.


The archive acts as a memory of everything evolution has already tried.
Update Rule: Every newly generated individual has a 10% probability of being added to the archive permanently.
Once in the archive, a robot stays there forever.

comparison pool = entire population + archive population
