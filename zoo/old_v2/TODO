EA tasks:
    ☐ make dynamic selection to decrease population size   [savio]    ☐ fitness score graphing function                      [sara]    ✔ make the list appending a bit more optimized         [salome] @done(25-11-10 21:56)
    ✔ normalize the fitness fitness function               [salome] @done(25-11-10 21:56)


10_000 results:
    ☐ add baseline from nx TED ????
    ☐ run it ???
    ✔ fitness score per individual @done(25-11-12 21:45)
    ✔ add gecko mutation demonstration @done(25-11-12 21:45)

random thoughts:
    ✘ similarity db score in ctk @cancelled(25-11-17 19:30) -> now dict!
    ☐ add static radius?
        ☐ look at chemistry first????



meeting:
    ☐ run 2 EA's
        ☐ 1. use matrix method.
            ☐ store/save novelty and diversity fitness
            ☐ plot both lines
            ☐ save top2 and lowest2 diversity/novelty? graphs at x generation interval
            ☐ create final photoshopped plot
        ☐ 2. use tfidf method.
            - idem.
        ☐ (3.) also to tfidf method for history archive instead of previous generation?

        ☐ future:
            ☐ use tfidf vectors for cross-similarity???
            ☐ what about cosine similarity???
            ☐ uniform vs lineair???


    - also talked about dynamic: re-initialise robots if you see fitness is in a minimal (not needed)
    - explain the hinges bias thing, but skip changin for now
